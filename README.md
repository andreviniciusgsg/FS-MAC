# Introduction
This project is an extension of FS-MAC. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/jeffRayneres/FS-MAC). FS-MAC+ provides a flexible and smart MAC sublayer. It implements machine learning techniques in order to select the best MAC protocol over time.

# MAC protocols
FS-MAC+ currently has 2 MAC protocols available, CSMA/CA and TDMA.

# Installation
In order to make life easier, an installation script is provided. It is called `install.sh`. All dependencies are installed by this script. It also installs FS-MAC+. By default, source code and dependencies are downloaded in the `home` directory. If nothing is changed, you should find the FS-MAC+ code on `~/FS-MACplus/gr-fsmac`.

# Examples
You can find some examples on folder gr-fsmac/examples. There are ready-to-go transceivers available. So, feel free to run some examples before to explore the project.
